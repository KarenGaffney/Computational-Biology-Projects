## Cancer Cell Invasion into Bone Marrow as an Ecological System
### This model simulates the invasion of cancer in to the bone marrow as an established eco system. This adapted Tilamn model of invasion dynamics defines cancer cells as the ### inferior species as they must grow in to the niches left behind by Hematopoetic Stem Cells (HSCs) to grow. HSCs are the superior species as they can hold on to their volume ### in the bone marrow aginst cancer cells until they die.

## Modeling Intracellular Calcium Oscillations and Performing 3-way Design of Experiments
### In this project I model intracellular calcium oscillations with a model taken from BIOMODELS. I investigate the oscillation frequency of ca+ in dependence with various 
### chemicals using telleurium. I perform preliminary testing to identify species of interest and perform a Design of Experiments to answer study questions.
